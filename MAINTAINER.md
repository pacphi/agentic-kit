# Maintainer's guide — `@pacphi/agentic-kit`

Everything a repository owner or maintainer needs to develop, test, package, and
release this kit. User-facing docs live in [README.md](README.md); this file is the
*inside* view.

> **What this package is:** a zero-runtime-dependency, cross-platform CLI (`ak` /
> `agentic-kit`) that installs, heals, and *proves* a ruflo + agentic-qe stack for
> Claude Code. It develops with **pnpm** but heals **npm-managed** global trees,
> because that's how ruflo/agentic-qe land on target machines.

## 1. Architecture at a glance

| Property | Value | Why it matters |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| Module system | **ESM only** (`.mjs`); `.cjs` reserved for the statusline template + its test | `"type": "module"` in `package.json` |
| Runtime deps | **Zero** | Uses `node:` builtins only — `node:sqlite`, `node:test`, `node:util` (`parseArgs`), `node:child_process`, `node:fs`. Keeps installs instant and supply-chain surface tiny |
| Node | **≥ 22** (`engines.node`) | `node:sqlite` + `node --test` need it. CI matrix covers 22 / 24 / 26 |
| Package manager (dev) | **pnpm** pinned via `packageManager: pnpm@11.13.0` | CI uses `pnpm/action-setup` which reads that field — don't drift it casually |
| Package manager (target) | **npm** | The kit heals `npm root -g` trees; `lib/heal.mjs` shells `npm install -g` |
| Version source of truth | `package.json` `version` **only** | `bin/agentic-kit.mjs --version` reads it at runtime; no version string is duplicated anywhere else in source |

### CLI shape (`bin/agentic-kit.mjs`)

- **Porcelain** (daily): `setup`, `status`, `sync`, `dashboard`, `uninstall`. Bare `ak` → `status --hint`. (`dashboard` is also reachable as `ak x dashboard`.)
- **Plumbing** (power users): `ak x daemon-gc | mcp | reference | verify | improvement-eval`.
- Each command module exports `options` (a `parseArgs` config) and `run({ flags, positionals, pkgRoot })`.
- A best-effort drift nudge runs after non-`sync`, non-`--json` commands.

**Published tarball** = the `files` whitelist in `package.json`:
`bin/agentic-kit.mjs`, `src/`, `claude/`, `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`. Nothing else
ships — verify with `npm pack --dry-run` before a release if you touch `files`.

> The consistency contract all managed tools share — install/update/version/display
> invariants, the per-tool table, and the add-a-tool checklist — lives in
> [docs/MANAGED-TOOLS.md](docs/MANAGED-TOOLS.md). The notes below are the
> brain-specific details behind that contract.

**RuvNet Brain is the odd one out.** ruflo/agentic-qe/the host CLIs are global npm
packages: detected via `installedVersion` (npm global root) and drift-checked with
`npm view`. The RuvNet Brain is *not* — `npx ruvnet-brain@latest` (the **published**
installer; never `github:`, which runs the unreleased default-branch HEAD) installs a
~512 MB offline KB to `~/.cache/ruvnet-brain/kb` (override `$RUVNET_BRAIN_KB`) and a
user-scope Claude Code plugin (the `search_ruvnet` MCP + hooks + a skill). So it gets a
*parallel* lifecycle in `src/lib/ruvnet-brain.mjs`: `present()` probes disk,
`latestVersion()`/`drift()` hit the GitHub releases API (TTL-cached in kit.json like
`selfDrift`). setup/sync install via `heal.installRuvnetBrain()`, which resolves the
latest release tag FIRST and pins the installer to it (`--version v<tag>`), so the
bundle on disk is exactly the release ak stamps — no install-then-stamp race.
Toggle with the `ruvnetBrain` kit.json flag / `--no-ruvnet-brain`.

> **Installer flag gotcha — `--yes` accepts *every* optional offer.** Audited live on the
> v3.3.1 installer (2026-07-17): under `--yes` it silently enables a nightly self-update
> LaunchAgent (`com.ruvnet.brain-update`, macOS, 03:47 — runs the bundle's
> `forge-update.mjs --apply`, which at v3.3.1 applies downloads **without signature
> verification**), writes telemetry consent, installs a spend-watchdog agent, and
> materializes model-router files. Hence `INSTALL_ARGS` carries FOUR suppression flags:
> `--no-stack --no-enhance` (ak manages ruflo/RuVector + the CLAUDE.md block) and
> `--no-nightly-prompt --no-telemetry` (ak owns updates; consent stays the user's).
> The nightly self-updater bypasses ak-managed updates, so `ak status` flags an existing
> agent as its own subsystem (`ruvnet-brain-nightly`) and `ak sync` disables it
> (`heal.disableRuvnetBrainNightly()`: `launchctl bootout` + plist removal — both steps,
> mirroring the installer's own `--disable-nightly`). Deliberate re-enrollment
> (`npx ruvnet-brain --enable-nightly`) gets re-flagged; opt ak out entirely with
> `ruvnetBrain:false`. The spend watchdog and telemetry consent of already-affected
> machines are left alone on purpose — local-only / a recorded user answer.

> **Version gotcha — three unrelated namespaces.** The plugin semver (`plugin.json`, e.g.
> `0.5.0-dev`), the KB bundle's `brainVersion` (e.g. `v0.3.0-dev`), and the GitHub **release
> tags** the installer downloads by (e.g. `v3.3.1`) are all different tracks. Evergreen-era
> release bundles stamp the release tag **on disk** (`SOURCE.json` → `releaseTag`), so the
> installed side resolves disk-first: `installedReleaseOnDisk()`, then **ak's own record**
> of the release it last pulled (`kit.json` → `versionCheck.ruvnetBrain.installedRelease`,
> written by `recordInstalledRelease()` after a successful install) for pre-stamping
> bundles. The statusline footer mirrors the same order, and the dashboard's update
> banner folds the brain in from the same `drift()` result (`foldBrainDrift()` in
> dashboard-server.mjs — driftReport only carries npm tools; the kit's own
> `selfDrift` is folded the same way), so `ak status`, the footer, and the
> dashboard can never disagree.
> `classifyDrift()` compares that resolved value vs `releases/latest` —
> same namespace, so it converges. A present-but-unstamped install (manual / pre-existing)
> surfaces as outdated once, so `ak sync` pulls it onto the managed track. Do **not**
> compare `installedVersion()` (plugin semver) against a release tag — that was the
> original bug and it can never converge.

### Dogfooding artifacts are NOT source

Running `ruflo init` / `aqe init` against *this* repo writes `.agentic-qe/`,
`.claude/`, `.claude-flow/`, `.swarm/`, `.mcp.json`, `*.db`, `*.rvf`, `ruvector.db`.
All are `.gitignore`d. **Never commit them.** If you see them staged, something
generated them in-tree.

---

## 3. Local development

```bash
pnpm install                      # dev only; repo is zero-dependency so this is tiny
node bin/agentic-kit.mjs --help --all
node bin/agentic-kit.mjs status --json     # exercise a command directly

# Optional: link the CLI globally to dogfood `ak` end-to-end
npm link                          # then `ak status`, `ak setup`, …  (npm, not pnpm, to match target)
```

Because everything is `node:` builtins, there is no build step — source runs as-is.
Edit a file under `src/`, re-run the CLI, done.

**House conventions**
- Output goes through `src/lib/output.mjs` (`ok`/`warn`/`fail`/`info`/`heading`/`bold`/`dim`) — never raw `console.log` for status lines, so formatting stays consistent.
- Heal actions in `lib/heal.mjs` return `{ ok, detail }` and **must be idempotent** (they run on every `sync`).
- Keep files focused and under ~500 lines; one concern per `lib/` file.
- Validate at boundaries; degrade gracefully when ruflo/aqe aren't installed (`status` must still emit valid JSON — CI asserts this).

---

## 4. Testing

```bash
pnpm test        # the full gate — exactly what CI runs
```

That expands to:

```bash
node --test "tests/kit/*.test.mjs" && node tests/statusline-segments.test.cjs
```

- `tests/kit/*.test.mjs` — `node:test` unit suites (blocks, natives, settings-config, versions). **32 tests.**
- `tests/statusline-segments.test.cjs` — statusline footer renderer. **20 tests.**
- **52 total, 0 failures = release-ready.**

Run one suite while iterating: `node --test tests/kit/versions.test.mjs`.

CI additionally runs a **CLI smoke** against a sandboxed `HOME` (see `ci.yml`):
`--version`, `--help --all`, `status --json` (asserts valid JSON + `overall`),
`x reference sync` (asserts managed blocks present), `uninstall --dry-run`. If you
change CLI output shape, expect the smoke to catch it.

---

## 5. Branching methodology

- **Default branch:** `main`. It is always releasable — CI runs on every push to it.
- **Small docs / fix commits** land **directly on `main`** (fast-forward). This is
  how `db4607c`, `b33bab2`, `571b593` (docs) went in.
- **Features and non-trivial fixes** go through a **short-lived branch → PR →
  squash-merge** with the PR number appended to the subject, e.g.
  `fix(setup): … (#20)`, `feat(sync): … (#18)`. GitHub auto-deletes the branch on
  merge; prune stale local refs with `git remote prune origin`.
- **Commit convention:** Conventional Commits — `feat` / `fix` / `docs` / `chore` /
  `release`. Release commits are exactly `release: vX.Y.Z`.
- **No `Co-Authored-By` trailers** on commits (repo history is clean of them; the
  tool is a facilitator, not an author).

Typical feature flow:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/thing            # off main
# … work, with `pnpm test` green …
git push -u origin feat/thing
gh pr create --fill                   # or --web
gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch  # after CI passes
git checkout main && git pull --ff-only
```

---

## 6. Versioning (SemVer)

`package.json` `version` is the single source of truth. The npm dist-tag is chosen
**by the shape of the version string** in `release.yml`:

| Version | Example | dist-tag | Meaning |
|---------|---------|----------|---------|
| Prerelease (`-…`) | `4.0.0-alpha.4` | **`next`** | Alpha/beta channel. `ak sync` on a prerelease install tracks `next` *and* `latest` |
| Stable | `4.0.1` | **`latest`** | GA. Stable installs only ever follow `latest` |

Bump rules while in the `4.0.0` alpha line:
- Bug fix or docs → `-alpha.N` → `-alpha.(N+1)`.
- Feature-complete / stabilizing → graduate to `-beta.0`.
- Ship 4.0 → drop the prerelease suffix → `4.0.0` (goes to `latest`).

No feature or breaking change is implied by an alpha bump — those are still 4.0.0.

---

## 7. Release & publish

Publishing is driven **entirely by pushing a `v*` tag**. `release.yml` re-runs the
test gate, enforces `tag == package.json version`, and `pnpm publish`es with npm
provenance. There is no manual `npm publish` step — and you should never run one.

### Checklist

```bash
# 0. Be on an up-to-date main with the release contents already merged.
git checkout main && git pull --ff-only
pnpm test                                   # must be green — CI will re-check anyway

# 1. Bump the version (edit package.json — the ONLY place it lives).
#    e.g. 4.0.0-alpha.4 -> 4.0.0-alpha.5

# 2. Sanity-check the CLI reports the new version.
node bin/agentic-kit.mjs --version          # -> 4.0.0-alpha.5

# 3. Commit with the release convention and push main.
git commit -am "release: v4.0.0-alpha.5"
git push origin main

# 4. Tag (annotated) to match EXACTLY, and push the tag — this is the deploy trigger.
git tag -a v4.0.0-alpha.5 -m "v4.0.0-alpha.5"
git push origin v4.0.0-alpha.5

# 5. Watch the publish.
gh run list --workflow=release.yml --limit 1
gh run watch "$(gh run list --workflow=release.yml -L1 --json databaseId -q '.[0].databaseId')" --exit-status

# 6. Verify it landed on the right dist-tag.
npm dist-tag ls @pacphi/agentic-kit
npm view @pacphi/agentic-kit@4.0.0-alpha.5 version dist.tarball
```

**The tag↔version guard is unforgiving:** if the tag name and `package.json`
version don't match, `release.yml` fails before publishing. That's the safety net —
if a release run fails on the guard, you tagged the wrong string.

### Requirements for publishing to work
- `NPM_TOKEN` repo secret — an npm **Automation** token with publish rights
  (already configured). Rotate with `gh secret set NPM_TOKEN`.
- `release.yml` has `id-token: write` for provenance attestation — keep it.

### If a release goes wrong
- **Failed on the guard / tests:** the package was NOT published. Fix, then move the
  tag (`git tag -d vX && git push origin :vX`, correct, re-tag, re-push) or cut the
  next patch.
- **Published a bad version:** don't try to re-publish the same version (npm forbids
  it). Publish a superseding version. Use `npm deprecate @pacphi/agentic-kit@X "…"`
  to warn installers; `npm unpublish` is a last resort and time-limited by npm policy.
- **Wrong dist-tag:** `npm dist-tag add @pacphi/agentic-kit@X next` / `… latest` to
  correct it without republishing.

## 8. GitHub workflow automation

| Workflow | Trigger | What it does | Gate? |
|----------|---------|--------------|-------|
| **`ci.yml`** | push to `main`/`npm-kit`, any PR, `workflow_dispatch` | Matrix **3 OS × 3 Node** (ubuntu/macos/windows × 22/24/26): `pnpm test` + CLI smoke against a sandboxed `HOME` | PR merge signal |
| **`release.yml`** | push tag `v*` | Test gate → **tag↔version guard** → `pnpm publish --provenance` (prerelease→`next`, stable→`latest`) | **Publishes** |
| **`nightly.yml`** | cron `17 6 * * *` (06:17 UTC), `workflow_dispatch` | Installs the **real latest** ruflo + agentic-qe via `npm -g`, runs `ak sync --no-upgrade` + deep proofs; fails on upstream drift in `natives`/`security` | Upstream-drift alarm |
| **`dependabot.yml`** | weekly, Monday | Grouped bumps: `github-actions` (keeps action majors current) + `npm` (watchdog even though repo is zero-dep) | Opens PRs |

Notes:
- `release.yml` is **independent of `ci.yml`** — it runs its own test gate on the
  tagged commit. A green `main` CI is reassurance, not a precondition for release.
- A **nightly failure means "upstream changed"**, not "this repo broke" — it's how
  we catch ruflo/aqe drift the day it ships. Triage by reading the drift message.
- Dependabot PRs carry `dependencies` (+ `ci`) labels; merge like any PR after CI.

## 9. `gh` CLI cookbook (by use case)

**Releases / publishing**
```bash
gh run list --workflow=release.yml --limit 5          # recent publish runs
gh run watch <run-id> --exit-status                   # follow one to completion
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed                     # why a publish failed
```

**CI**
```bash
gh workflow run ci.yml                                # manual matrix run (workflow_dispatch)
gh run list --workflow=ci.yml --branch main --limit 5
gh run rerun <run-id> --failed                        # re-run only failed jobs
```

**Nightly upstream-drift probe**
```bash
gh workflow run nightly.yml                           # force a live-drift check now
gh run list --workflow=nightly.yml --limit 3
```

**Pull requests**
```bash
gh pr create --fill                                   # open PR from current branch
gh pr checks                                          # CI status for the PR
gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch                  # standard merge
gh pr list --label dependencies                       # pending Dependabot PRs
```

**Repo config / secrets**
```bash
gh secret list                                        # confirm NPM_TOKEN present
gh secret set NPM_TOKEN                               # rotate the publish token
gh repo view --web                                    # open on GitHub
```

**Optional — GitHub Releases**
The kit currently ships via npm on tag push and does **not** create GitHub Release
objects. To add human-readable release notes alongside a tag:
```bash
gh release create v4.0.0-alpha.5 --generate-notes     # after the tag is pushed
```
